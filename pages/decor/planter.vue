    <p>
      The planter pot can be used to plant all sorts of different plants on it depending on the top
      that is currently set. Right clicking on the block with an empty hand will rotate the type
      which you can see by the texture on the top. Depending on the top it will check if the plant
      that is trying to be placed is supported. Other checks like if water is nearby still come into
      play.

      You will need to smelt and unfired planter pot to get a block you can actually place.
