    <h1><a name="ruins">Ruins</a></h1>
    <p>
      Assorted World adds in many different structures that can be naturally generated in the world.
      The following are known as ruins and can be thought of as remnants of a past civilization that
      left them behind. Some of them you can find treasures that were left behind in them while
      others can end up being empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the structures are configurable if you would like to adjust the way they spawn. They
      should all follow the same pattern for performing adjustments.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="runes">Runes</a></h2>
    <p>
      All Ruins have a chance of spawning one of the 16 types of <b>Runes</b>. Each of these have a
      different status effect that can be applied to you when you come into contact with them. You
      will need to find them all to figure out which ones are the best.
