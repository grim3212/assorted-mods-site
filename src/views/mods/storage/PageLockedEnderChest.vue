      The Locked Ender Chest is a new block that adds the ability to have multiple seperate Ender
      Chest inventories saved and can be accessed by anyone else who has the same code use to lock
      it.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="crafting">Crafting</a></h2>
    <p>
      There are two ways to get a Locked Ender Chest. The first is in a crafting table combine an
      Ender Chest and a <b>Locksmith Lock</b> with a saved code. One without a code will not work.
      Then you will get a Locked Ender Chest locked with that code.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second option is to just <b>Shift+Right Click</b> an Ender Chest with a
      <b>Locksmith Lock</b> with a saved code. This will turn the Ender Chest into a Locked Ender
      Chest locked with that code.

    <h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
    <p>
      Each separate Locked Ender Chest locked with a different code is a completely seperate
      inventory then the others. So you can have an huge amount of seperate Locked Ender Chests to
      store different items in.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ever want the normal Ender Chest back just <b>Shift+Right Click</b> on one and the lock
      will pop off provided you are able to access the inventory of what it is locked with.
