    <p>
      Item Towers are an interesting way of storing your items but they cannot be locked. Each one
      can store 18 stacks in two rows. But when stacked on top of each other you can access all of
      them from the one you open. When hoppers or pipes are involved they also have access to all of
      the towers.
