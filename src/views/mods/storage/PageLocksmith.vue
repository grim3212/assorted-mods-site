      Almost all the blocks within <i>Assorted Storage</i> can be locked and then opened with the
      correct key. Using the locksmith workbench you are able to set a code on locks and keys to
      restrict access to only those that have a key of the same code.

    <p>
      Using this workbench will allow you to define a code for keys and locks. As long as the lock
      and key code are the same you will be able to open blocks.

    <h2><a name="lock">Locksmith Lock</a></h2>
    <p>
      Once a code has been set on a lock simply right click a supported storage block to lock it and
      restrict access to it.

    <h2><a name="key">Locksmith Key</a></h2>
    <p>
      You just need to have this key somewhere within your inventory and you will be able to open
      storage blocks that are locked with its code.
