      Alarms are blocks that when powered with redstone will play a predefined sound that you set.
      They can also be placed on any side of a block as well as be waterlogged.

      There are currently 14 different sounds that you can select between in the Gui that will open
      with a Right-Click. Just click the middle button <i>Alarm A</i> to cycle through the different
      sounds. The <i>Test</i> button will play the sound for only you to hear. And to save your
      changes make sure you click the <i>Done</i> button at the bottom.
