    <h1><a name="boomerangs">Boomerangs</a></h1>
    <p>
      Boomerangs as you would think can be thrown and then will return to you after they reach their
      maximum distance.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="wooden">Wooden Boomerangs</a></h2>
    <p>
      Wooden boomerangs can be thrown with right click and will go once it hits it's maximum
      distance it will return to you.

    <h2><a name="diamond">Diamond Boomerangs</a></h2>
    <p>
      Diamond boomerangs by default can be thrown farther and do more damage to entities. They work
      exactly like wooden ones but can be changed in the config to be able to follow where you are
      looking.
