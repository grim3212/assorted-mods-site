    <h1><a name="spears">Spears</a></h1>
    <p>
      This mod adds 8 different types of spears. These vary from spears just for throwing and
      damaging to spears that when they land perform different things.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2><a name="base">Base Spear</a></h2>
    <p>
      To craft any of the spears you must first build the most basic spear the flint spear. All
      other spears are upgrades of the flint spear into various directions.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2><a name="regular">Regular Spears</a></h2>
    <p>
      There are 2 other `regular` spears beyond the flint spear. They each do extra damage relative
      to the material they are built with. They are the Iron and Diamond Spear.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2><a name="slime">Slime Spears</a></h2>
    <p>
      The slime spear is similar to the Regular spears as it doesn't do anything to special. The
      unique piece about the slime spear is that it will bounce when thrown off the ground.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="special">Special Spears</a></h2>
    <p>
      The rest of the spears added (Explosive, Fire, Light, Lightning) all have various things
      happen when they hit the ground or in some cases an Entity.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3><a name="explosive">Explosive Spears</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Explosive Spear as the name implies will explode when it hits and Entity or the ground. Be
      careful where you are throwing this.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h3><a name="fire">Fire Spears</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Fire Spear will try and start fires around the area it lands on the ground. This is not
      guarenteed but is very likely to happen.
    </p>
    <img src="\mods\tools\fire_spear_recipe.png" />
    <h3><a name="light">Light Spears</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Light Spear will try and place a torch at the location that it lands. It will only damage
      entities if it hits one.
    </p>
    <img src="\mods\tools\light_spear_recipe.png" />
    <h3><a name="lightning">Lightning Spears</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Lightning Spear will bring down lightning on the Entity or the location that it lands.
      Extremely useful just try not to hit yourself.
