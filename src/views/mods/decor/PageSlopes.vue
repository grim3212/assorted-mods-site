    <h1><a name="slopes">Slopes</a></h1>
    <p>
      There are many <i>Slopes</i> that Assorted Decor adds as well. These slopes usually provide
      shapes that you can't normally get with Minecraft's model system and allow you're world to
      look a bit smoother. All slopes should support being <i>waterlogged</i> and being placed
      differently depending on the side of the block that it is placed on and where on that side
      that it was, think upside down stairs.

    <h2><a name="slope">Colorizer Slope</a></h2>
    <p>Slopes are half of a full block and operate the same as straight stairs.</p>

    <h2><a name="sloped_angle">Colorizer Sloped Angle</a></h2>
    <p>Sloped angles point towards a corner and can be waled up like a corner stair.</p>

    <h2><a name="slanted_corner">Colorizer Slanted Corner</a></h2>

    <h2><a name="oblique_slope">Colorizer Oblique Slope</a></h2>
    <p>
      Oblique slopes act as a corner piece on stairs and are basically missing a slanted corner.

    <h2><a name="sloped_intersection">Colorizer Sloped Intersection</a></h2>
    <p>
      Sloped intersections are what would happen if two slopes were combined and act as corner
      stairs.

    <h2><a name="pyramid">Colorizer Pyramid</a></h2>
    <p>Pyramids only count as half a block, and are just a small pyramid.</p>

    <h2><a name="full_pyramid">Colorizer Full Pyramid</a></h2>
    <p>
      Large pyramids can be climbed up but the highest point is in the middle as you would suspect.
