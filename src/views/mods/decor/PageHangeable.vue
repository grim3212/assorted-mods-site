    <h2><a name="calendar">Calendar</a></h2>
    <p>
      Calendar are a good way to keep track of how much time has passed in your Minecraft world.
      They will automatically add up the amount of time that has passed and give the appropriate
      year, month, and day for the current day. No needing to tear off the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE: If you set the time use `/time set {some value}` this will disrupt the time that the
      calendar uses. So the actual time will not be accurate.

    <h2><a name="chair">Wall Clock</a></h2>
    <p>
      Wall Clocks are basically a better looking clock on the wall. Who needs items frames when you
      can get a clean looking wall clock that functions the exact same as a normal clock.
